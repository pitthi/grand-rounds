# Health Informatics Grand Rounds, University of Pittsburgh

Organized by the [Department of Health Informatics](https://www.shrs.pitt.edu/hi), [School of Health and Rehabilitation Sciences](https://www.shrs.pitt.edu/) at the [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.pitt.edu/), the <strong>Health Informatics Grand Rounds</strong> is a <em><strong>publicly</em></strong> and <em><strong>freely</em></strong> available <strong>seminar/webinar</strong> series which mainly aims to offer a professional forum for health data scientists and AI-powered healthcare researchers to present their latest research findings and innovations.

We aim to expose students to cutting-edge work in health informatics and to engage faculties to build new collaborations by inviting world-class external speakers from both academia and industry. The Health Informatics Grand Rounds is sponsored by the [Center for Bioethics and Health Law](https://bioethics.pitt.edu/), the [Pitt Research, Ethics and Society Initiative](https://www.research.pitt.edu/about/research-ethics-and-society-initiative), and the [IEEE Computer Society](https://www.computer.org/) at Pittsburgh.
